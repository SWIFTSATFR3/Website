Software Defined Radio based Emulation of SAT-Terrestrial Network Coexistence in FR3 Bands is a <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2332637&HistoricalAwards=false">NSF</a> project focused on creating an over-the-air indoor FR3 testbed for experimental studies of coexistence between terrestrial and satellite systems, using software-defined radios (SDR) to emulate dense 5G cellular networks and satellite equipment. The FR3 testbed is an extension of an existing testbed, the <a href="https://wiki.cosmos-lab.org/">COSMOS</a> sandbox at Rutgers University WINLAB, and is an open resource remotely accessible to other researchers.
