In contrast to earlier studies, we will take an emulation based approach here. The 12 GHz SDR development in section 5.1 will allow the deployment of NGSO-FSS receivers in COSMOS along with multiple 5G BS and UEs. Further, the radio mapping algorithm in COSMOS enabled by distributed noise injection allows the creation of arbitrary 5G network topologies on the testbed that correspond to real world network scenarios. Specifically, we will use the noise injection framework to generate topologies where both line of sight (LOS) and non line of sight (NLOS) paths exist between the FSS receivers and the 5G transmitters as shown. The SDRs developed allow emulation of beamforming gains, angles of interference as well as control of modulation formats, transmit power and transmission bandwidth. Further, the control plane architecture in COSMOS allows the emulation of a centralized spectrum server [59] that can coordinate 5G transmissions. It also allows the realization of spectrum sharing algorithms using a distributed control plane implementation. We will use both the centralized server and distributed control plane implementations to study the following.
