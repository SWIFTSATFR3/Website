Krieger\u0026rsquo;s work enabled ATACS to efficiently add context variables to complete the state coding of a system, thereby removing ambiguity. This work allowed for the insertion of the minimum number of context variables by carefully choosing where to insert the variables and their transitions.\nAfter graduation, Chris worked at Hewlett-Packard and Intel in their microprocessor design labs. He developed EDA tools for server microprocessors and worked as a microprocessor performance architect. Over his career, he worked on two HP PA-RISC® processors (8700/8800), 5 Itanium® processors, 1 Xeon® processor and 1 Atom® processor.\nChris returned to school and completed a PhD program in Computer Science at Colorado State University. His advisor was Dr. Michelle Strout. For his dissertation, Krieger researched a new programming language abstraction, called a loop chain. By identifying a group of loops as a loop chain, compilers and runtime optimizers can perform a variety of code and data transformations to improve locality (e.g. full sparse tiling), concurrency (shared memory autoparallelization), or arithmetic intensity (improved vectorization).\nDr. Krieger is now a lead researcher in the Advanced Computing Systems group at the Laboratory for Physical Sciences on the University of Maryland campus.

The center’s educational mission is to train the next generation of wireless technologists via advanced research experiences integrated with academic programs.\nWINLAB (Wireless Information Network Laboratory), an industry-university cooperative research center focused on wireless technology, was founded at New Jersey’s Rutgers University in 1989. Its research mission is to advance the development of wireless networking technology by combining the resources of government, industry and academia. The center’s educational mission is to train the next generation of wireless technologists via graduate research programs that are especially relevant to industry.\nWINLAB has enjoyed considerable success in achieving these goals. The center has completed over 30 years of research on wireless data networks, and has made a number of important technical contributions to mobile computing, high speed modem design, radio resource management, network architectures and protocols and programmable network/wireless testbeds . In fulfillment of its educational aims, to date WINLAB has also produced over 150 MS and PhD graduates specializing in wireless technology. These graduates are playing a key role within leading wireless technology and service companies as they work toward the center’s vision of deploying the Mobile Internet.\nSince its inception, WINLAB has been supported by a broad cross section of leading wireless industry sponsors, including several major wireless equipment vendors, chip manufacturers and service providers based in the United States, Europe and Japan.

This project creates an over-the-air indoor FR3 testbed for experimental studies of coexistence between terrestrial and satellite systems, using software-defined radios (SDR) to emulate dense 5G cellular networks and satellite equipment. The FR3 testbed is an extension of an existing testbed, the COSMOS sandbox at Rutgers University WINLAB, and is an open resource remotely accessible to other researchers. This project uses the FR3 testbed to investigate technologies supporting terrestrial-satellite coexistence, including Machine Learning for radio resource management, interference identification and mitigation. Experimental studies enabled by the testbed are important as a complement to more widely performed modeling and analysis studies, to help make better decisions about how to share FR3 between new cellular systems, existing actively transmitting commercial satellites (e.g. digital broadcast) and existing passively observing scientific satellites (e.g. weather forecasting) without harmful interference to the satellites. Additionally, the project engages students at multiple levels, leveraging the broad outreach capabilities of WINLAB and Rutgers. The project focuses on spectrum sharing between terrestrial 5G and active commercial satellites in the 12.2-12.7 GHz band, and adjacent band coexistence between terrestrial 5G at 10-10.5 GHz and passive scientific satellites in the 10.6-10.7 GHz band. Software and hardware are designed that emulate 5G radio networks, commercial satellite transceivers, and passive radiometers in the targeted frequency bands. Metamaterial software-defined beamforming is used to emulate coexistence with satellites like non-geostationary orbit fixed satellite service (NGSO-FSS), and hot-cold calibration and comparison to datasets from on-orbit AMSR-E and AMSR2 sensors is used to enhance the reliability and realism of radiometer interference experiments. There are three thrusts - (1) design, validate and deploy FR3 SDR-based heterodyne devices, emulation of 5G New Radio (NR) and SAT waveforms, and coexistence emulation methods; (2) use emulation experiments to develop centralized Machine Learning algorithms for integrated radio resource management in sharing between terrestrial 5G and active commercial satellites; and (3) use emulation experiments to assess radiometer sensitivity to terrestrial 5G interference and to develop Machine Learning algorithms for interference identification and mitigation by passive scientific satellites. One outcome of the work in thrust 2 and thrust 3 is a measurement of the fraction of spectrum assigned to the terrestrial 5G cellular system that is \"lost\" due to the strategies used to mitigate interference to satellites.","tags":["Spectrum Coexistence","Heterodyne Transceiver","Machine Learning"],"title":"SWIFT-SAT Software Defined Radio based Emulation of SAT-Terrestrial Network Coexistence in “FR3” Bands","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Chris Myers"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1599483787,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1599483787,"objectID":"f4ebbdabfbb60bf4eda9d7039e167f1f","permalink":"https://swiftsatfr3.github.io/project/sbol/","publishdate":"2020-09-07T10:03:07-03:00","relpermalink":"/project/sbol/","section":"project","summary":"Synthetic Biology Open Language","tags":["Standards"],"title":"SBOL","type":"project"},{"authors":["H.

No currently available minimizers for literal-exact two-level hazard-free logic minimization of extended burst-mode gC controllers can handle large circuits without synthesis times ranging up over thousands of seconds. Even existing heuristic approaches take too much time when iterative exploration over a large design space is required and do not yield minimum results. The logic minimization approach presented in this paper is based on state graph exploration in conjunction with single-cube cover algorithms, an approach that has not been considered for minimization of extended burst-mode finite state machines previously. Our algorithm achieves very fast logic minimization by introducing compacted state graphs and cover tables and an efficient single-cube cover algorithm for single-output minimization. Our exact logic minimizer finds minimal number of literal solutions to all currently available benchmarks, in less than one second on a 333 MHz microprocessor-more than three orders of magnitude faster than existing literal exact methods, and over an order of magnitude faster than existing heuristic methods for the largest benchmarks. This includes a benchmark that has never been possible to solve exactly in number of literals before.","tags":["asynchronous circuits","asynchronous circuit","hazard-free logic minimization","Iterative methods","Jacobian matrices","logic minimization","minimisation of switching nets","state graph exploration","logic circuits","space exploration","circuit","circuit synthesis","automata","hazards","finite state machine","microprocessors","minimization methods"],"title":"Achieving fast and exact hazard-free logic minimization of extended burst-mode gC finite state machines","type":"page"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"300db838c7a68c4fd14037dd038d2e1c","permalink":"https://swiftsatfr3.github.io/courses/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/courses/","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"","type":"widget_page"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"60abaeb405147d861bb55801d25d30df","permalink":"https://swiftsatfr3.github.io/research/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/research/","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"","type":"widget_page"},{"authors":["funding"],"categories":null,"content":"This project is based upon work supported by the National Science Foundation under Grant No. 2332637.
